## Analysis Summary
- **Impact of Vote Splitting**: The analysis reveals that the split between Conservative and Reform UK votes cost the Conservatives 176 seats. If the votes had been combined, they would have won 297 seats instead of 121 (and 5 for Reform UK), drastically changing the election outcome.
- **Labour's Majority**: Without the split, Labour would have lost their sweeping majority, securing only 268 seats instead of 412.
- **Coalition Requirement**: Neither party would have secured a majority, necessitating a coalition, which would have dramatically altered the political landscape.
